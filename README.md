# Autonomous Company Operator

An AI employee that turns a company request into **completed, verified work**.

It plays a Customer Support Operations Associate at **QuickBite**, a fictional
food-delivery company modelled on platforms like Swiggy and Zomato. Given a
ticket such as *"My Coke wasn't in the bag"*, it works out what needs doing from
the company's own procedures and policies. It then operates QuickBite's
back-office web apps in a real browser, asks a human when policy requires it,
checks independently that the outcome really happened, and returns evidence.

> Built against the CentrAlign AI Founding Engineer problem statement.
> See [`docs/BLUEPRINT.md`](docs/BLUEPRINT.md) for the full design.

**Status:** step 6 of 13 (language-model brain). See the
[build plan](docs/BLUEPRINT.md#6-build-plan).

## The core loop

```
Goal → Understand → Plan → Execute → Observe → Adapt → Verify → Complete
```

## Repository layout

| Path | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `company_operator/` | The AI employee: runtime, planning, verification, tools, memory, policy, LLM client, queue, audit log, API, Company Pack loader |
| `sandbox/quickbite/` | QuickBite's sandboxed systems: Support Desk, Ops Admin, Payments Console |
| `company_packs/quickbite/` | QuickBite's SOPs, policies, systems and permissions, stored as data ([details](company_packs/quickbite/README.md)) |
| `dashboard/` | React + TypeScript dashboard |
| `evals/` | Scenario harness and reliability scorecard |
| `tests/` | Test suite |
| `docs/` | Blueprint, architecture and design decisions |

## Setup

Requirements: Python 3.12+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node.js 22+. `make install` downloads
Playwright's Chromium; to use an existing Chromium instead, set `ACO_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make install      # Python deps, Chromium for Playwright, dashboard deps
```

## Language model

The operator's thinking phases (understand, plan, next action, summary) use a
language model through a provider-neutral interface:

| Provider | Setting | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Google Gemini | `ACO_LLM_PROVIDER=gemini` | Free key at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) |
| OpenAI-compatible | `ACO_LLM_PROVIDER=openai_compatible` + `ACO_LLM_BASE_URL` | Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama, OpenAI, vLLM… |

`ACO_LLM_MODELS` is an ordered list:

- If a model is overloaded, it is retried with backoff, and then the next
  model takes over.
- If a model reports that it is out of quota, it is skipped for the time the
  provider asks for.
- Every model call is recorded in the run's audit log, with model, tokens and
  latency.

Free tiers have small daily request limits, so one form (several fields, then
submit) is completed in a single model turn.

## Run

```bash
make sandbox      # QuickBite's back-office apps on http://127.0.0.1:8100
make api          # operator API on http://127.0.0.1:8000
make dashboard    # dashboard on http://localhost:5173
```

The sandbox's systems, logins, scenario catalogue and fault injection are
documented in [`sandbox/quickbite/README.md`](sandbox/quickbite/README.md).

## Develop

```bash
make check            # lint + typecheck + tests (what CI runs)
make format           # auto-format Python
make dashboard-build  # type-check and build the dashboard
```
